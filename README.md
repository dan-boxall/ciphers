ciphers
=======


Encipher and decipher text using caeser, atbash and vigenere methods. Caeser also has a bruteforcer :-)

The advanced vigenere cipher does not remove spaces or convert to uppercase - there is no need, as there are now 95 possible characters, including spaces.

Just follow the instructions when the programs are run.

NOTE THAT THESE PROGRAMS WILL ONLY RUN WITH PYTHON 3.x
